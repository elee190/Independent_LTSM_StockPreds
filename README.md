# Stock Predictions with LTSM and FastAI Deep Learners

If you are interested in leveraging deep learning to predict stock price, check this notebook.

Here, I use a simple three layers LSTM model (which was cutting-edge just a few years ago!) to predict the stock price for Facebook. I also implemented deep learners from the modern FastAI library to understand the advancements in machine learning research since 2019.

The purpose of this notebook is not trying to challenge the traditional ways to predict the market. Rather, it shows how deep learning could be adopted to predict the market movement in a straightforward way. Enjoy!
